# Welcome!

This example uses new StateSmith features that are really helpful:
1. draw.io vscode plugin.
2. C# script files.

While you don't have to use StateSmith with vscode (you can go pure CLI),
it is really handy.

# Install instructions üì¶
Install `dotnet` and `dotnet-script`:
https://github.com/StateSmith/StateSmith/wiki/StateSmith-install-requirements

## (Optional) draw.io üñâ
You'll also want to install the `draw.io` vscode extension:
https://marketplace.visualstudio.com/items?itemName=hediet.vscode-drawio

## (Optional) Intellisense üîç
To get intellisense for our C# scripts, install the official C# vscode extension:
https://marketplace.visualstudio.com/items?itemName=ms-dotnettools.csharp

# Walk Through üö∂
I haven't had time to make a full tutorial, but you can follow the state machine design steps 
(ignoring the use of yEd and some scripts) here: 
https://github.com/StateSmith/StateSmith/blob/main/docs/quickstart1/quick-start.md#open-the-diagram

‚ù§Ô∏è I'd love a PR that adds a new quick-start.md for this new and improved workflow.
