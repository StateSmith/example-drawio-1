# Cross Platform Example
Tested on Linux and Windows. Should work on mac as well.

This example uses new StateSmith features that are really helpful:
1. draw.io vscode plugin.
2. C# script files.

While you don't have to use StateSmith with vscode (you can go pure CLI),
it is really handy.

# Install instructions üì¶
Install `dotnet` and `dotnet-script` by following [this wiki page](https://github.com/StateSmith/StateSmith/wiki/StateSmith-install-requirements).

## draw.io (optional) üñâ
You'll also want to install the draw.io [vscode extension](https://marketplace.visualstudio.com/items?itemName=hediet.vscode-drawio).

## Intellisense (optional) üîç
To get intellisense for our C# scripts, install the [official C# vscode extension](https://marketplace.visualstudio.com/items?itemName=ms-dotnettools.csharp).

You'll also need to run a few terminal commands for vscode to understand C# script files:

```
dotnet script init delete_me_dummy_file.csx
rm ./delete_me_dummy_file.csx
```

Then restart vscode and you should be good to go!

# The Image is The Source!
One of the really cool features of draw.io is that the viewable svg file is also the design - as shown below! This is pretty excellent!

![](./src/Tutorial1Sm.drawio.svg)

The one downside though is that editable draw.io xml is embedded as binary in the svg. This can be tricky if you have multiple developers changing the svg on different git branches and wanting to merge the changes together. This is a common problem with some other state machine software like Matlab Simulink. You could also choose to use a regular XML `.drawio` files instead of `drawio.svg` files. This usually isn't an issue we run into at my work.

# Walk Through üö∂
I haven't had time to make a full tutorial, but you can follow the state machine design steps 
(ignoring the use of yEd and some scripts) [here](https://github.com/StateSmith/StateSmith/blob/main/docs/quickstart1/quick-start.md#open-the-diagram).

‚ù§Ô∏è I'd love a PR that adds a new quick-start.md for this new and improved workflow.
