# Quick Start Guide
I haven't had time to make a full tutorial, but you can follow the state machine design steps (ignoring the use of yEd and some scripts) here: https://github.com/StateSmith/StateSmith/blob/main/docs/quickstart1/quick-start.md#open-the-diagram

I'd love a PR that updates this example repo with an updated walk through :)
